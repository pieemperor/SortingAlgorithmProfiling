# SortingAlgorithmProfiling

In this project, I compared the speed of many of the common sorting algorithms to see when to use each of them. 
This was for my Data Structures class. 

The purpose of this project was to get experience using the Visual Studio code profiler. The project also 
showed me what situations are most appropriate for each sorting algorithm. 

Each sorting algorithm was run on code that was random, sorted, and almost sorted. They were also run on small, medium, 
and large sets of data. The data from the profiler is kept in an excel spreadsheet in the repository. A paper stating
my conclusions can also be found in the repository.
